2015 Hackathon 

Ideas:

1. get all contacts' address from Google, or search for friends in a location--text individually over time interval?
2. twilio, customer notifications for promotion, discount, deals (QPX Express API -- Google API)
3. location API, pokemon collection/badge
4. twilio notifications for monitoring deal usage/danger, crime rate
